# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

## Files
- `run_analysis.R` is the script file includes all functions required to fulfil the assignment.
- "Average.txt" is the cleaned dataset that generated by using the R script above. It contains average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- "README.md" provides relevant information of the project and the R script.
- "codebook.md" describes the variables.

## `run_analysis.R` Description
The R script aimed to achieve the following 5 tasks:
- 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
- 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
- 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
- 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

### Required R Packages
- `dplyr` package was required

### Key Functions - in execution order
- `file.exists()`: checked the availability of directory and source data
- `dir.create()`: created subdirectory for source data
- `download.file()`: downloaded the source zip file 
- `unzip()`: decompressed the zip file
- `read.table()`: imported the source training and test data into R
- `cbind()` and `rbind()`: merged all data together
- `grep()`: located mean and standard deviation for each measurement
- `factor()`: replaced the activity codes to descriptive activity names
- `gsub()`: replaced variable names with more descriptive names
- `dplyr::group_by()`: grouped data by 'subject' and 'activity'
- `dplyr::summarize_each()`: calculated the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
- `write.table()`: exported the cleaned dataset to `Average.txt`
